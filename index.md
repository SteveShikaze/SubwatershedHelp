This document provides Help and a quick reference for the new Watershed Tool from ORMGP

# What is the Watershed Tool?

The ORMGP Watershed Tool (https://owrc.github.io/subwatershed/) is a mapping tool where the Oak Ridges Moraine jurisdiction has been divided into subwatersheds, each covering an area of approximately 10 square kilometres.

A watershed is defined as an area of land where all water drains to a particular water body (e.g., lake, river segment).  A subwatershed is a portion of a watershed where water drains to a smaller water body within the larger watershed. Each of the subwatersheds shown in this tool is located within larger subwatersheds and watersheds.  

Upon opening the tool, the map shows the entire ORMGP area, with each discrete subwatershed colour-coded based on imperviousness. The user can select other options for the colour of the watersheds: 
- Canopy coverage 
- Wetland coverage 
- Open water coverage 
- Permeability

The interactive tool provides properties of each subwatershed that the user selects.  When a subwatershed is selected, the properties of the selected watershed appear in a window.
