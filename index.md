# What is the Subwatershed Tool?

The ORMGP Subwatershed Tool (https://owrc.github.io/subwatershed/) is a mapping tool where the Oak Ridges Moraine jurisdiction has been divided into subwatersheds, each covering an area of approximately 10 square kilometres.

A watershed is defined as an area of land where all water drains to a particular water body (e.g., lake, river segment).  A subwatershed is a portion of a watershed where water drains to a smaller water body within the larger watershed. Each of the subwatersheds shown in this tool is located within larger subwatersheds and watersheds.  

Upon opening the tool, the map shows the entire ORMGP area, with each discrete subwatershed colour-coded based on imperviousness. The user can select other options for the colour of the watersheds: 
- Imperviousness
- Canopy coverage 
- Wetland coverage 
- Open water coverage 
- Permeability 

In Figure 1, the imperviousness is colour-coded for each subwatershed.  Darker blue subwatersheds are more impervious, whereas lighter colours are more permeable.

The interactive tool provides properties of each subwatershed that the user selects.  When a subwatershed is selected, the properties of the selected watershed appear in a window. These properties include:
- area of subwatershed
- permeability
- percent impervious cover
- percent canopy cover
- percent open water cover 
- percent wetland cover

In Figure 2, the map is zoomed in to see the individual subwatershed boundaries in more detail. Properties of the selected subwatershed are shown in a pop-up.
